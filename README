After a discussion of ways of setting the correct error format for various compilers on vim-dev, I threw together this script to allow you to do:
:Compiler bcc55

and have the errorformat for compiler be setup.  Currently it replaces the default errorformat, but is easily changed to be appended to the current value of errorformat.  Uses the :runtime command to search for a filename (this case, bcc55.vim) in a 'compiler' directory under one of the runtime directories.  Commonly, ~/.vim/compiler.
